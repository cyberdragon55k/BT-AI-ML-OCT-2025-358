## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for the AI/ML assignment provided by Badkul Technology Pvt Ltd. The project consists of two main tasks:
1.  A **classification task** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
2.  A **regression task** to predict house prices based on various property features.

The goal is to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification)

### Objective
To build a binary classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

### Dataset
The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
els were evaluated based on their accuracy and classification reports on a held-out test set.

## 🏠 Task 2: House Price Prediction (Regression)

### Objective
To apply regression techniques to predict the sale price of houses using a dataset with both numerical and categorical features.
### Dataset
The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
